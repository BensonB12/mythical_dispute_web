# Mythical Dispute <br /> <sub>Draft Your Animal Army</sub>
## By Benson Bird

The Mythical Creatures are going extict, not from Humans, but from *Eachother*

You and your opponent are a Mythical Creatures, kill, or get killed.

Before your big battle, you and your opponent go out to recruit your Animal Army. This will be represented by a deck of cards. At the end of the draft/recruitment the battle will be decited by your total power in the Water location, Land location, and Air location. Whoever wins in two out of the three locations defeats the other! Ties will result is some tie breakers.

In this game you recruit animals, eat animals, and these animals have special abilities that syncronise with eachother, with you, and even care about what your opponents creatures look like!

This game is a take on 'Winston Drafting' from Magic The Gathering.
